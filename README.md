# JSX and React
This repository serves to document my learning of JSX and React. This is an application to obtain the user's input of a search term, display relevant images to the search term. 

## What I Have Used

**React and JSX**
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


## Getting Started
For an offline version, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
